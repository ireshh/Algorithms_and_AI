## Summary of Work Done

During this week, My main focus was on establishing the foundation for my project by completing these following tasks:
- I selected **Heads-Up Poker AI** as the project topic, making sure it met the course's scope and requirements.
- I finalized the programming language and project specifications:
  - **Programming Language**: Python
  - **Degree Program**: Bachelor of Science (BSc)
  - **Documentation Language**: English
- I created a **Project Specification Document** that outlines the project goals, problem definition, key algorithms, data structures, inputs, and complexity considerations.
- I set up the project repository on GitHub with version control enabled for all files.
- I enabled **GitHub Issues** for future peer-review assignments and collaboration.
- and I Registered the project on **Labtool** and linked it to the Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Algoritmit ja tekoäly (periodi 2, 2024-2025) for tracking and feedback.

## Project Progress

- I believe the project is off to a good start, with the topic and main specifications decided.
- The Documentation and organizational setup is nearly complete.

## Lessons Learned

- I learned more about structuring a project repository to meet this courses requirements, including linking files for easy access and peer review.
- I refreshed my memory on Markdown formatting for documentation, which hopefully will be useful throughout the project.
- I gained a better understanding of defining project specifications, which definitely helped clarify the project scope.

## Challenges and Unclear Areas

- No significant challenges so far, as this week primarily involved planning and setup and I got help from the moodle page.

## Plan for Next Week

- I will begin implementing the basic game mechanics and structure for heads-up poker.
- I will start working on a basic version of the **Monte Carlo Simulation** for initial probability calculations.
- and develop the initial layout for the decision tree that the AI will use to make moves.

## Questions and Feedback for Course Assistant

- At this point, no major questions. However, any feedback on the project specification and scope would be appreciated to ensure that the project aligns with course expectations.
